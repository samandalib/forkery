# 🚨 Current Architecture Limitations

> **Comprehensive documentation of Forkery's current architectural constraints and aggressive port management approach**

## 📅 **Created**: December 2024  
## 🎯 **Status**: Current State Documentation  
## 🚨 **Priority**: High (Architecture Awareness)  
## 📋 **Purpose**: Explain current limitations and design decisions  

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

### **Current Reality**
Forkery's current architecture is designed for **single-project workspaces** and uses an **aggressive port conflict resolution** system. This design choice, while effective for its intended use case, creates significant limitations for users who want to:

- 🚫 **Run multiple projects simultaneously**
- 🚫 **Work on parallel development tasks**
- 🚫 **Maintain stable development environments**
- 🚫 **Collaborate with team members on different projects**

### **Why This Design Exists**
The aggressive approach was chosen for **simplicity and reliability** in the early development phases:
- ✅ **Guaranteed Success**: Always finds an available port
- ✅ **Simple Logic**: No complex conflict resolution needed
- ✅ **Predictable Behavior**: Users know exactly what will happen
- ✅ **Fast Startup**: No time wasted on negotiation

### **The Trade-off**
This design prioritizes **reliability over flexibility**, creating a "port bully" system that works well for single users but creates friction in multi-project scenarios.

## 🏗️ **Current Architecture Design**

### **Core Principle: "First Come, First Served"**
```
Project A starts → Takes port 3000 → Project B starts → Kills Project A → Takes port 3000
```

### **Port Management Flow**
```typescript
// Current aggressive approach in findAvailablePort()
private async findAvailablePort(desiredPort: number): Promise<number> {
  try {
    // 🚨 FIRST: Aggressively kill any processes using the desired port
    await this.killProcessesOnPort(desiredPort);
    
    // Wait for processes to fully terminate
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    
    // THEN: Check port availability
    const availablePort = await detectPort(desiredPort);
    
    if (availablePort === desiredPort) {
      this.outputChannel.appendLine(`✅ Port ${desiredPort} is available after cleanup`);
    } else {
      this.outputChannel.appendLine(`⚠️ Port ${desiredPort} still busy after cleanup, using ${availablePort} instead`);
    }
    
    return availablePort;
  } catch (error) {
    return desiredPort; // Fallback
  }
}
```

### **Process Cleanup Strategy**
The system uses a **three-tier cleanup approach**:

1. **Port-Specific Cleanup**: Kill processes on the exact port
2. **Framework-Specific Cleanup**: Kill all processes of the same framework type
3. **Nuclear Cleanup**: Kill all Node.js processes as last resort

```typescript
private async killProcessesOnPort(port: number): Promise<void> {
  // Use lsof to find processes using the port
  const findProcess = child_process.spawn('lsof', ['-ti', `:${port}`], {
    stdio: 'pipe',
    shell: true
  });
  
  // Kill each process found
  for (const pid of pids) {
    // First try graceful termination
    await this.killProcess(pid, 'SIGTERM');
    
    // If still running, force kill
    if (processStillRunning(pid)) {
      await this.killProcess(pid, 'SIGKILL');
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚫 **Specific Limitations**

### **1. No Parallel Development Support**

#### **What Happens When You Try**
```
Scenario: User has Project A running on port 3000
Action: User tries to start Project B (also wants port 3000)

Result: 
1. Project A is automatically killed
2. Project B takes port 3000
3. Project A is no longer accessible
4. User loses work context and must restart Project A
```

#### **Why This Happens**
- **Single Workspace Design**: Extension assumes one project per workspace
- **Port Exclusivity**: Each port can only serve one project
- **No Coordination**: No mechanism to coordinate between multiple projects

### **2. Aggressive Port Takeover**

#### **The "Port Bully" Behavior**
```typescript
// The system doesn't ask permission - it just takes what it needs
await this.killProcessesOnPort(desiredPort);  // Kills without warning
await this.killExistingFullstackProcesses();  // Kills all fullstack projects
await this.killAllNodeProcesses();            // Nuclear option
```

#### **Real-World Impact**
- **Unexpected Shutdowns**: Projects stop without user consent
- **Lost Work Context**: Developers lose their development environment
- **Frustration**: "Why did my project stop?" confusion
- **Productivity Loss**: Time spent restarting projects

### **3. Framework Port Conflicts**

#### **Default Port Collisions**
| Framework | Default Port | Conflict Probability |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **React** | 3000 | **HIGH** - Most popular framework |
| **Next.js** | 3000 | **HIGH** - Also very popular |
| **Vite** | 5173 | **MEDIUM** - Growing popularity |
| **HTML/CSS** | 8080 | **LOW** - Less common |

#### **Why Conflicts Are Common**
- **Popular Frameworks**: React and Next.js both use port 3000
- **Multiple Projects**: Developers often work on multiple React/Next.js projects
- **No Port Reservation**: System doesn't reserve ports for specific projects

### **4. Single Workspace Constraint**

#### **Architectural Decision**
From the documentation:
> **Single Project**: One workspace = one preview (v1)

#### **What This Means**
- **One Extension Instance**: Only one Forkery extension per VS Code window
- **One Project Context**: Extension can only manage one project at a time
- **No Cross-Project Coordination**: Can't manage ports across multiple projects

---

## 🔍 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Port Detection System**

#### **Current Implementation**
```typescript
// The system uses detectPort library for port availability
import detectPort from 'detect-port';

// But it kills processes BEFORE checking availability
await this.killProcessesOnPort(desiredPort);
const availablePort = await detectPort(desiredPort);
```

#### **Why This Approach**
- **Guaranteed Success**: Killing processes ensures port availability
- **No Negotiation**: Simple binary decision (available/not available)
- **Fast Resolution**: No time wasted on conflict resolution

### **Process Management**

#### **Current Cleanup Strategy**
```typescript
// Three-tier cleanup approach
private async killExistingProcesses(desiredPort: number): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Port-specific cleanup
  await this.killProcessesOnPort(desiredPort);
  
  // 2. Framework-specific cleanup
  if (framework === 'fullstack') {
    await this.killExistingFullstackProcesses();
  } else if (framework === 'vite') {
    await this.killExistingViteProcesses();
  }
  
  // 3. Nuclear cleanup
  await this.killAllNodeProcesses();
}
```

#### **Why So Aggressive**
- **Reliability**: Ensures port conflicts are always resolved
- **Simplicity**: No complex conflict resolution logic needed
- **Performance**: Fast startup without negotiation delays

## 🎯 **Use Cases That Don't Work**

### **1. Multiple Project Development**
```
❌ User wants to work on:
- Project A (React app) on port 3000
- Project B (Next.js app) on port 3001
- Project C (Vite app) on port 5173

Result: Only one project can run at a time
```

### **2. Team Collaboration**
```
❌ Team member A starts Project X on port 3000
❌ Team member B tries to start Project Y on port 3000
Result: Project X is killed, causing confusion and lost work
```

### **3. Parallel Feature Development**
```
❌ Developer working on feature A (port 3000)
❌ Developer working on feature B (port 3000)
Result: Features can't be developed simultaneously
```

### **4. Testing Multiple Configurations**
```
❌ Testing production build (port 3000)
❌ Testing development build (port 3000)
Result: Can't compare configurations side-by-side
```

## 🚨 **User Experience Impact**

### **Common User Complaints**

#### **"Why Did My Project Stop?"**
- **Frequency**: High - happens every time port conflicts occur
- **Impact**: User frustration and lost productivity
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive process killing without user notification

#### **"I Can't Run Multiple Projects"**
- **Frequency**: Medium - affects users with multiple active projects
- **Impact**: Limited development workflow flexibility
- **Root Cause**: Single workspace design constraint

#### **"Port Conflicts Are Confusing"**
- **Frequency**: Medium - affects users who don't understand the system
- **Impact**: Reduced confidence in the tool
- **Root Cause**: Lack of clear communication about port management

### **Workflow Disruptions**

#### **Development Flow Interruption**
```
1. User starts Project A → Works for 30 minutes
2. User starts Project B → Project A is killed
3. User loses context → Must restart Project A
4. User loses 5-10 minutes restarting and re-establishing context
```

#### **Testing Workflow Issues**
```
1. User tests Project A → Finds bug
2. User starts Project B to test fix → Project A is killed
3. User can't verify fix → Must restart Project A
4. Testing cycle becomes inefficient
```

## 🛠️ **Current Workarounds**

### **1. Multiple Workspaces**
```
✅ Open each project in a separate VS Code window
✅ Each window gets its own Forkery extension instance
✅ Projects can run simultaneously on different ports
```

**Limitations**:
- **Resource Intensive**: Multiple VS Code instances
- **Context Switching**: Alt+Tab between windows
- **No Coordination**: Can't manage projects together

### **2. Manual Port Configuration**
```
✅ Modify package.json scripts to use different ports
✅ Use environment variables to override defaults
✅ Configure frameworks to use non-standard ports
```

**Limitations**:
- **Manual Work**: Requires user intervention
- **Configuration Drift**: Ports can get out of sync
- **Framework Specific**: Different approaches for different frameworks

### **3. Sequential Operation**
```
✅ Start one project, stop it, then start another
✅ Use the system's port conflict resolution
✅ Let the system handle port reassignment
```

**Limitations**:
- **Time Consuming**: Can't work on multiple projects simultaneously
- **Context Loss**: Lose development state when switching
- **Inefficient**: Not suitable for parallel development workflows
