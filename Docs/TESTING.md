# üß™ Testing Guide

This guide will walk you through testing all the features of the One-Click Local Preview extension.

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Extension compiled successfully (`npm run compile`)
- ‚úÖ Cursor or VS Code installed
- ‚úÖ Node.js 16+ installed

### Step 1: Open Extension in Cursor
1. Open the `forkery` folder in Cursor
2. Press `F5` to start debugging
3. A new "Extension Development Host" window will open
4. **Keep both windows open** - the original for code, the new one for testing

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Empty Workspace (New Project Creation)

**Goal**: Test the "from scratch" workflow for designers

**Steps**:
1. In the Extension Development Host window:
   - File ‚Üí Open Folder
   - Create a new empty folder (e.g., "test-project")
   - Open it

2. **Expected Result**: Status bar shows **üöÄ New Project**

3. Click the **üöÄ New Project** button

4. **Expected Result**: Template picker opens with 6 options:
   - Next.js App
   - Vite + React
   - Astro Site
   - Remix App
   - Gatsby Site
   - Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

5. Choose **"Next.js App"**

6. **Expected Result**: Confirmation dialog appears

7. Click **"Yes"**

8. **Expected Result**: 
   - Progress notification: "Creating Next.js App project..."
   - Output panel shows creation logs
   - Success message: "üéâ Next.js App project created successfully! Start preview now?"

9. Click **"Start Preview"**

10. **Expected Result**:
    - Status bar shows: **‚ü≥ Starting...**
    - Then: **‚óè Preview: Running on :3000**
    - Preview opens in Simple Browser panel
    - Next.js welcome page loads

### Scenario 2: Existing Project (Preview Functionality)

**Goal**: Test the preview system with an existing project

**Steps**:
1. In the Extension Development Host window:
   - File ‚Üí Open Folder
   - Navigate to the `sample-project/` folder in this repository
   - Open it

2. **Expected Result**: Status bar shows **‚ñ∂ Preview**

3. Click the **‚ñ∂ Preview** button

4. **Expected Result**:
   - Status bar shows: **‚ü≥ Starting...**
   - Output panel shows server logs
   - Then: **‚óè Preview: Running on :3000**
   - Preview opens with the sample Next.js page

5. **Test the sample page**:
   - Click the counter button (should increment)
   - Verify the extension features list is visible
   - Check that the page is responsive

### Scenario 3: Stop and Restart Preview

**Goal**: Test process management

**Steps**:
1. With preview running (from Scenario 1 or 2):
   - Status bar should show: **‚óè Preview: Running on :3000**

2. Click the **‚óè** button

3. **Expected Result**:
   - Status bar shows: **‚ñ∂ Preview** (or **üöÄ New Project** if no project)
   - Server stops
   - Preview closes
   - Notification: "Preview stopped"

4. **Test restart**:
   - Command Palette: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Preview: Restart"
   - **Expected Result**: Server starts again, preview reopens

### Scenario 4: Command Palette Integration

**Goal**: Test all commands are accessible

**Steps**:
1. Open Command Palette: `Cmd+Shift+P`

2. Type "Preview:" and verify these commands appear:
   - **Preview: Run** (when no preview is running)
   - **Preview: Stop** (when preview is running)
   - **Preview: Restart** (when preview is running)
   - **Preview: Create New Project** (always available)

3. Test each command to ensure they work correctly

### Scenario 5: Error Handling

**Goal**: Test graceful error handling

**Steps**:
1. **Test missing dependencies**:
   - Create a new project
   - Delete the `node_modules` folder
   - Try to start preview
   - **Expected Result**: Extension prompts to install dependencies

2. **Test port conflicts**:
   - Start a preview (e.g., on port 3000)
   - In another terminal: `npx http-server -p 3000`
   - Try to start another preview
   - **Expected Result**: Extension finds an available port automatically

3. **Test invalid project**:
   - Open a folder without `package.json`
   - Try to start preview
   - **Expected Result**: Extension offers to create a new project

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Extension Logs
1. In the Extension Development Host:
   - View ‚Üí Output
   - Select "Preview Logs" from dropdown
   - Look for detailed server output and error messages

### Check Debug Console
1. In the original Cursor window:
   - View ‚Üí Debug Console
   - Look for extension activation and command execution logs

### Common Issues
- **Extension not activating**: Check `package.json` activation events
- **Commands not working**: Verify command registration in `registerCommands()`
- **Preview not opening**: Check browser mode setting and Simple Browser extension
- **Port conflicts**: Check if another service is using the port
